# Mobile app for Brick and Mortar retail [WIP]
A simple mobile app using Expo, written in React Native. This app is intended for use by staff in small-midsize retail businesses. This app currently uses Firebase to hold sample data. However, this could easily be replaced with another database or data from an API.
